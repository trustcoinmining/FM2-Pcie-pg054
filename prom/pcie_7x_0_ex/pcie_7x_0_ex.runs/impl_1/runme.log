WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-11] CONFIG_VOLTAGE with HR Config Banks: Unable to determine configuration voltage for configuration Bank 14. When multi-function configuration banks are being used for configuration Vivado must be able to determine the configuration voltage to be used. Using PERSIST or EMCCLK implies that a multi-function configuration bank is being used. If this is not the case, please do not use these settings. Otherwise, if the bank is being used for configuration, please use set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE [current_design] to indicate the voltage to be used.
